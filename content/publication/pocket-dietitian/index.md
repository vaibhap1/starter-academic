abstract: A root cause of chronic disease is a lack of timely informed decision power in everyday lifestyle choices, such as in diets. Users are unable to clearly delineate and demand healthy food in a quantitative manner. To scale the benefit of health nutrition coaching in broad real-world scenarios, we need a technological solution that is constantly able to interpret nutrition information. We ingest nutritional facts about products to efficiently calculate which items are healthiest. We deliver these results to users based on their location context. Our ranking algorithm outperforms major nutrition score metrics, and is more consistent than human dietitians in real world scenarios. Most importantly, our system gives the user a rapid way to connect with healthy food in their vicinity, reducing the barriers to a healthy diet.
