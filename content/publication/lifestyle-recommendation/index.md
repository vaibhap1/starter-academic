abstract: Managing health lays the core foundation to enabling quality life experiences. Modern multimedia research has enhanced the quality of experiences in fields such as entertainment, social media, and advertising; yet lags in the health domain. We are developing an approach to leverage multimedia systems for human health. Health is primarily a product of our everyday lifestyle actions, yet we have minimal health guidance on making everyday choices. Recommendations are the key to modern content consumption and decisions. Cybernetic navigation principles that integrate health media sources can power dynamic recommendations to dramatically improve our health decisions. Cybernetic components give real-time feedback on health status, while the navigational approach plots health trajectory. These two principles coalesce data to enable personalized, predictive, and precise health knowledge that can contextually disseminate the right actions to keep individuals on a path to wellness.
