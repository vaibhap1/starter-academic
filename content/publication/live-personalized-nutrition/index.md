abstract: Dietary choices are the primary determinants of prominent diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Human health care providers, such as dietitians, cannot be at the side of every user at all times to manually guide them towards optimal choices. Automated adaptive guidance fused with expert knowledge can use multimedia data to technologically scale health guidance without human intervention. Addressing the correct granularity of recommendations (in this case meal dishes) is essential for effortless decision making. Thus we make a decision support system using multi-modal data relying on timely, contextually aware, personalized data to find local restaurant dishes to satisfy a user's needs. Algorithms in this system take nutritional facts regarding products, efficiently calculate which items are healthiest, then re-rank and filter results to users based on their personalized health data streams and environmental context. Our recommendation engine is driven by the primary goal of lowering the barriers to a personalized healthy choice when eating out, by distilling dish suggestions to a single contextually aware and easily understood score.
